# Task Flows

> Technical architecture guidance for Microsoft Fabric projects.

Task flows is a documentation-only knowledge base of pre-defined architectures, decision guides, and deployment validation for Microsoft Fabric. It includes five GitHub Copilot custom agents that collaborate in phases:

```
@fabric-advisor ──► @fabric-architect (DRAFT) ──► @fabric-engineer + @fabric-tester (Review)
──► @fabric-architect (FINAL) ──► @fabric-tester (Test Plan) ──► ★ YOU (Sign-Off) ──►
@fabric-engineer (Deploy) ──► @fabric-tester (Validate) ──► @fabric-documenter (ADRs)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Check Project Status

Open [`PROJECTS.md`](PROJECTS.md) at the repo root to see all projects and their current phase. Each project also has a detailed `STATUS.md` tracker at `projects/{name}/STATUS.md`.

### Using the Agents

Start a project by mentioning **@fabric-advisor** in chat and describing your problem. The pipeline flows automatically through these phases:

- **@fabric-advisor** — Discovers your problem, infers architectural signals, produces a Discovery Brief
- **@fabric-architect** — Selects task flow, walks through decisions, produces Architecture Handoff
- **@fabric-engineer** + **@fabric-tester** — Review the DRAFT handoff in parallel for feasibility and testability
- **@fabric-architect** — Incorporates review feedback into FINAL handoff
- **@fabric-tester** — Produces Test Plan from FINAL handoff
- **YOU** — Review architecture + test plan and approve (Phase 2b — the only human gate)
- **@fabric-engineer** — Deploys items by dependency wave
- **@fabric-tester** — Validates deployment against checklist
- **@fabric-documenter** — Generates wiki-style ADRs

### Problem-First Discovery

The **@fabric-advisor** agent starts every new project by asking: *"What problems does your project need to solve?"* It infers architectural signals (data velocity, use case, task flow candidates) from the user's natural-language description and produces a **Discovery Brief**.

The pipeline then continues automatically — **@fabric-architect** receives the brief, confirms the inferred signals, fills in remaining gaps (skillset, workspace), and proceeds with the full decision walkthrough. If no Discovery Brief is available, the architect can also start fresh with its core questions.

Values not collected by the architect are prompted just-in-time by the **@fabric-engineer** at deployment time, with sensible defaults.

```

The advisor discovers the problem, and the pipeline flows automatically through design, review, and test planning. **You review and approve** the architecture and test plan (the only manual step), then deployment, validation, and documentation continue automatically. Each agent produces structured **handoff documents** — the architect's includes a Design Review section documenting what feedback was incorporated.

The [Visualization Selection](decisions/visualization-selection.md) guide includes comprehensive **Direct Lake** guidance — the recommended Semantic Model query mode for any Fabric source with Delta tables in OneLake:

| Fabric Source | Direct Lake Support | How Data Reaches OneLake |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Lakehouse | ✅ Native | Delta tables stored directly |
| Warehouse | ✅ Native | Tables stored as Delta/Parquet |
| SQL Database | ✅ Via mirroring | Automatic mirroring to Delta format |
| Eventhouse / KQL Database | ✅ Via OneLake availability | Enable OneLake availability |
| Mirrored Databases | ✅ Via mirroring | Fabric mirroring from external sources |

## 🤖 Custom Agents

### @fabric-advisor

**Purpose:** Problem discovery and scoping — the first agent users interact with

**Responsibilities:**
- Ask what problems the project needs to solve
- Infer architectural signals (data velocity, use case, task flow candidates) from the problem description
- Confirm inferences with the user
- Produce a Discovery Brief for `@fabric-architect`

### @fabric-architect

**Purpose:** Guide architecture decisions before deployment

**Responsibilities:**
- Accept Discovery Brief (or gather requirements directly if invoked without one)
- Recommend task flow + walk through decision guides
- Recommend Semantic Model query mode (Direct Lake by default)
- Produce Architecture Handoff with decisions, items, deployment order, acceptance criteria, alternatives considered, and trade-offs

### @fabric-tester

**Purpose:** Test planning (pre-deployment) and validation (post-deployment)

**Mode 1 (Pre-Deployment):**
- Receive Architecture Handoff → produce Test Plan
- Map acceptance criteria to validation checklist phases
- Identify pre-deployment blockers and edge cases

**Mode 2 (Post-Deployment):**
- Receive Deployment Handoff → execute validation checklist from `validation/{task-flow}.md`
- Verify items with `fab exists`, `fab ls`, `fab get`
- Report validation status (PASSED / PARTIAL / FAILED)

### @fabric-engineer

**Purpose:** Deploy Fabric items based on architecture

**Key capabilities:**
- **Parallel deployment** — Analyzes dependency graph and deploys items in concurrent waves (see `_shared/parallel-deployment.md`)
- **Sub-agent delegation** — Orchestrates waves sequentially but delegates items within a wave to parallel sub-agents
- **Dual tooling** — Supports `fab` CLI (interactive) and `fabric-cicd` library (automated CI/CD)
- **Direct Lake configuration** — Configures optimal query mode for all Fabric sources
- **Rollback & error recovery** — Wave failure protocol with cleanup decision table
- **Just-in-time prompting** — Only asks for values when needed per item, with sensible defaults

### @fabric-documenter

**Purpose:** Synthesize all pipeline handoffs into wiki-style documentation

**Produces in `projects/{workspace}/docs/`:**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) explaining the "why" behind each choice
- System architecture overview with item relationships
- Deployment log with configuration rationale
- CI/CD ADR (006-cicd.md) when multi-environment

## ⚡ Deployment & CI/CD

### Deployment Tooling

| Tool | Best For | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Fabric CLI** (`fab`) | Interactive, ad-hoc, learning | `pip install ms-fabric-cli` |
| **fabric-cicd** library | Automated CI/CD pipelines | `pip install fabric-cicd` (v0.1.23+) |

### Parallel Deployment

The engineer agent groups items into **dependency waves** based on the "Depends On" column in deployment diagrams. Items within a wave deploy concurrently; waves execute sequentially:

```
Wave 1: Foundation items (no dependencies)     ─── parallel ───►
Wave 2: Items depending only on Wave 1         ─── parallel ───►
Wave 3: Items depending on Wave 2              ─── parallel ───►
```

### CI/CD Practices

See `_shared/cicd-practices.md` for the full reference:
- Workspace strategy presented as a user choice (single vs multi-workspace)
- `fabric-cicd` integration with `parameter.yml` for environment-specific values
- Per-item deployment gotchas (Notebook lakehouse binding, Environment publish time, Semantic Model manual connection)
- Connection management and capacity pool configuration
- Autoscale Billing as alternative to fixed capacity SKUs

## 📂 Content Routing

All content resolves by **task flow ID** (e.g., `medallion`, `lambda`, `event-analytics`):

| Content Type | Path Pattern |
|--------------|-------------|
| Task flow overview | `task-flows.md` → H2 anchor (`## Medallion`) |
| Deployment diagram | `diagrams/{task-flow-id}.md` |
| Validation checklist | `validation/{task-flow-id}.md` |
| Project docs | `projects/{workspace}/docs/` |
| Project deployments | `projects/{workspace}/deployments/` |
| Decision guides | `decisions/{decision-id}.md` |
| Shared references | `_shared/{file}.md` |

## 📝 Contributing

### Adding a New Task Flow

1. Add H2 section to `task-flows.md` with standard structure
2. Create `diagrams/{task-flow-id}.md` with phased deployment flow
3. Create `validation/{task-flow-id}.md` with phase-by-phase checklist
4. Reference decision guides in the task-flows.md section

### Terminology Rules

- Path templates use hyphenated form: `{task-flow-id}`

### Updating Agents

Agent files are in `.github/agents/`. Each includes:
- Three-tier boundaries (✅ Always / ⚠️ Ask first / 🚫 Never)
- Signs of Drift (role-specific indicators)
- Quality Checklists (pre-handoff self-review)
- Structured handoff templates
