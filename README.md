# Task Flows

> Technical architecture guidance for Microsoft Fabric projects.

Task Flows is a documentation-only knowledge base of pre-defined architectures, decision guides, and deployment validation for Microsoft Fabric. It includes four GitHub Copilot custom agents that collaborate in phases:

```
@fabric-architect (DRAFT) ──► @fabric-engineer + @fabric-tester (Design Review)
@fabric-architect (FINAL) ──► @fabric-tester (Test Plan) + @fabric-engineer (Deploy)
                               @fabric-tester (Validate) → @fabric-documenter (ADRs)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using the Agents

From VS Code / GitHub.com with GitHub Copilot, mention an agent in chat:

1. **@fabric-architect** — Describe your requirements → get a task flow recommendation and Architecture Handoff
2. **@fabric-tester** (Mode 1) — Receive the handoff → produce a Test Plan with acceptance criteria and pre-deployment blockers
3. **@fabric-engineer** — Deploy items using dependency-wave parallelism with `fab` CLI or `fabric-cicd`
4. **@fabric-tester** (Mode 2) — Validate the deployment against the task flow checklist
5. **@fabric-documenter** — Generate wiki-style ADRs explaining the "why" behind each decision

### Core vs Advanced Mode

The **@fabric-architect** uses a two-tier prompting model:

- **Core** (5 questions, always asked): Project name, development velocity, skillset + language follow-up, primary use case, workspace (existing or new)
- **Advanced** (opt-in): Capacity pools, environment names, Event Hub config, source connections, alert thresholds

Values not collected by the architect are prompted just-in-time by the **@fabric-engineer** at deployment time, with sensible defaults.

### Agent Pipeline (Collaborative Phases)

```
Phase 1 — Design:
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│  Architect   │──DRAFT──►│  Engineer   │── Deployment Feasibility Review
│  (Leads)     │         │  (Reviews)  │
│              │         └─────────────┘
│              │         ┌─────────────┐
│              │──DRAFT──►│   Tester    │── Testability Review
│              │         │  (Reviews)  │
│              │         └─────────────┘
│              │◄── feedback ──────────┘
│  (Finalizes) │
└──────┬───────┘
       │ FINAL Architecture Handoff
       ▼
Phase 2 — Plan + Deploy:
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│   Tester    │         │  Engineer   │
│ (Test Plan) │         │  (Deploy)   │
└──────┬──────┘         └──────┬──────┘
       │                       │
       ▼                       ▼
Phase 3 — Validate:     Phase 4 — Document:
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│   Tester    │────────►│  Documenter  │
│ (Validate)  │         │  (ADRs/Wiki) │
└─────────────┘         └──────────────┘
```

The architect leads design but collaborates with the engineer (deployment expertise) and tester (testability expertise) before finalizing. Each agent produces structured **handoff documents** — the architect's includes a Design Review section documenting what feedback was incorporated.

The [Visualization Selection](decisions/visualization-selection.md) guide includes comprehensive **Direct Lake** guidance — the recommended Semantic Model query mode for any Fabric source with Delta tables in OneLake:

| Fabric Source | Direct Lake Support | How Data Reaches OneLake |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Lakehouse | ✅ Native | Delta tables stored directly |
| Warehouse | ✅ Native | Tables stored as Delta/Parquet |
| SQL Database | ✅ Via mirroring | Automatic mirroring to Delta format |
| Eventhouse / KQL Database | ✅ Via OneLake availability | Enable OneLake availability |
| Mirrored Databases | ✅ Via mirroring | Fabric mirroring from external sources |

## 🤖 Custom Agents

### @fabric-architect

**Purpose:** Guide architecture decisions before deployment

**Responsibilities:**
- Ask core questions (5) with optional advanced deep-dive
- Follow up on code-first language (T-SQL, Python/PySpark, Spark/Scala, Mixed)
- Recommend task flow + walk through decision guides
- Recommend Semantic Model query mode (Direct Lake by default)
- Produce Architecture Handoff with decisions, items, deployment order, acceptance criteria, alternatives considered, and trade-offs

### @fabric-tester

**Purpose:** Test planning (pre-deployment) and validation (post-deployment)

**Mode 1 (Pre-Deployment):**
- Receive Architecture Handoff → produce Test Plan
- Map acceptance criteria to validation checklist phases
- Identify pre-deployment blockers and edge cases

**Mode 2 (Post-Deployment):**
- Receive Deployment Handoff → execute validation checklist from `validation/{task-flow}.md`
- Verify items with `fab exists`, `fab ls`, `fab get`
- Report validation status (PASSED / PARTIAL / FAILED)

### @fabric-engineer

**Purpose:** Deploy Fabric items based on architecture

**Key capabilities:**
- **Parallel deployment** — Analyzes dependency graph and deploys items in concurrent waves (see `_shared/parallel-deployment.md`)
- **Sub-agent delegation** — Orchestrates waves sequentially but delegates items within a wave to parallel sub-agents
- **Dual tooling** — Supports `fab` CLI (interactive) and `fabric-cicd` library (automated CI/CD)
- **Direct Lake configuration** — Configures optimal query mode for all Fabric sources
- **Rollback & error recovery** — Wave failure protocol with cleanup decision table
- **Just-in-time prompting** — Only asks for values when needed per item, with sensible defaults

### @fabric-documenter

**Purpose:** Synthesize all pipeline handoffs into wiki-style documentation

**Produces in `projects/{workspace}/docs/`:**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) explaining the "why" behind each choice
- System architecture overview with item relationships
- Deployment log with configuration rationale
- CI/CD ADR (006-cicd.md) when multi-environment

## ⚡ Deployment & CI/CD

### Deployment Tooling

| Tool | Best For | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Fabric CLI** (`fab`) | Interactive, ad-hoc, learning | `pip install ms-fabric-cli` |
| **fabric-cicd** library | Automated CI/CD pipelines | `pip install fabric-cicd` (v0.1.23+) |

### Parallel Deployment

The engineer agent groups items into **dependency waves** based on the "Depends On" column in deployment diagrams. Items within a wave deploy concurrently; waves execute sequentially:

```
Wave 1: Foundation items (no dependencies)     ─── parallel ───►
Wave 2: Items depending only on Wave 1         ─── parallel ───►
Wave 3: Items depending on Wave 2              ─── parallel ───►
```

### CI/CD Practices

See `_shared/cicd-practices.md` for the full reference:
- Workspace strategy presented as a user choice (single vs multi-workspace)
- `fabric-cicd` integration with `parameter.yml` for environment-specific values
- Per-item deployment gotchas (Notebook lakehouse binding, Environment publish time, Semantic Model manual connection)
- Connection management and capacity pool configuration
- Autoscale Billing as alternative to fixed capacity SKUs

## 📂 Content Routing

All content resolves by **task flow ID** (e.g., `medallion`, `lambda`, `event-analytics`):

| Content Type | Path Pattern |
|--------------|-------------|
| Task flow overview | `task-flows.md` → H2 anchor (`## Medallion`) |
| Deployment diagram | `diagrams/{task-flow-id}.md` |
| Validation checklist | `validation/{task-flow-id}.md` |
| Project docs | `projects/{workspace}/docs/` |
| Project deployments | `projects/{workspace}/deployments/` |
| Decision guides | `decisions/{decision-id}.md` |
| Shared references | `_shared/{file}.md` |

## 📝 Contributing

### Adding a New Task Flow

1. Add H2 section to `task-flows.md` with standard structure
2. Create `diagrams/{task-flow-id}.md` with phased deployment flow
3. Create `validation/{task-flow-id}.md` with phase-by-phase checklist
4. Reference decision guides in the task-flows.md section

### Terminology Rules

- **"Direct Lake"** — Always two words with space (never "DirectLake")
- **"task flow"** — Always two words with space (never "taskflow")
- Path templates use hyphenated form: `{task-flow-id}`

### Updating Agents

Agent files are in `.github/agents/`. Each includes:
- Three-tier boundaries (✅ Always / ⚠️ Ask first / 🚫 Never)
- Signs of Drift (role-specific indicators)
- Quality Checklists (pre-handoff self-review)
- Structured handoff templates
